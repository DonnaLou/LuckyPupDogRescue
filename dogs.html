        <h3>Please take a few moments to read:</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">
          If you have questions about a specific pup, please feel free to email us: 
          LuckyPupDogRescue @ gmail .com </br>

          If there is a dog you are interested in meeting, 
          we must have an application on file before we set a time to meet. 
          We can set up a meet &amp; greet after 
          we have your completed application and our staff has had time to review it. </br>

          Our pups live in foster homes located around San Diego. 
          We do not have a central facility where our dogs live. </br>

          We are volunteers, with jobs, families and busy schedules. 
          To help save time, we ask that you bring all family members, roommates, 
          everyone who lives in the home to the meeting, including your other dog(s) 
          if they are going to be part of the decision. We usually meet in a park nearby.
          It helps to streamline the adoption process and to make sure it's a great fit for everyone. </br>

          <strong>Our adoption process is simple:
          we require an approved application, home check 
          and a minimum $200 donation to our rescue. (Puppies $ 250) </strong> </br>

          All of our wonderful dogs have been lovingly rescued, nursed back to health. 
          They have been seen by a vet, are neutered/spayed, up to date on shots, wormed &amp; flea meds and have microchips. Your donations help us buy food, pay for vet visits, transportation from San Bernardino County, blankies, teeth cleaning, extractions, shots, 
          blood tests, flea meds, worming, grooming, 
          pulling teeth, broken bones, knee surgeries, boarding and all the things our pups
          need to get ready to be adopted into their forever home. </br>

          Some of our pups may stay with us for many, many months before they find the perfect home. 
          We make every effort for a great happily ever after. </br>

          Please know that not every dog is a good fit for every person, family or situation. 
          An application or meet &amp; greet does not a guarantee an adoption will take place. </br>

          WE ARE A VOLUNTEER BASED 501c3 DOG RESCUE * IRS EIN. # 90-0753223
